# FiveMExec Imigui Design

⛔ This is not a undetected/working FiveM executor. This is simply a imigui UI, forked from hammafia.co
📄 You can download a preview, in x64, and run the .exe for preview.

Inside the FiveM-Exec, you can see Lux Exec, with buttons and internals, dumpers and file dumpers. For changes and updates, colour themes are located in function, void Menu::Theme() You can set text, change sizes, radius and more. Do not sell this.
